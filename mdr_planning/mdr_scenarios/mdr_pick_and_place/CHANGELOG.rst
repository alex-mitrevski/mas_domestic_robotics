  Catkin Changes & Package updates for Indigo
  - Updates setup.py for newer version of catkin
  - Updates repository.debs for indigo versions
  - Updates repository.rosinstall to get indigo version from ipa320, our forks aren't up to date (yet)
  - Updates EmergencyStopState includes to new location:
  In cob_relay 0.5.6 the EmergencyStopState was moved
  http://docs.ros.org/indigo/changelogs/cob_relayboard/changelog.html
  I've separated the commits so you can cherry pick the ones you want.
  You may not like f7e2b9412, where I changed repository.rosinstall to get the version from ipa320 instead of mas-group, I just did that to save time.
